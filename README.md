# SRL Shared Utilities

Here is a repo for shared utils. How do you know if something should be a shared util? Well, if you need to use a function in more than one context, there is a good chance it might benefit someone else as well.

As much as we want to grow this repo, and have people contribute, we also need to have in place some quality metrics for code and documentation to ensure that it remains usable. Ideally, these practices would eventually spread to other repos as well :)
